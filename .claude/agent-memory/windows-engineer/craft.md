- No Windows lab on the Linux box: only `GOOS=windows go vet` is possible. Say NOT RUN on Windows in advance notes; never imply proof.
- x/sys/windows lacks JOBOBJECT_CPU_RATE_CONTROL_INFORMATION (define locally: class 15, enable 0x1, hard cap 0x4) and LookupPrivilegeName (use advapi32 LookupPrivilegeNameW).
- Edit SDDL via SecurityDescriptorFromString/ACLFromEntries/SetDACL, never string concat.
- Fitness scans of .wxs must strip XML comments first; comments legitimately say "never LocalSystem".
- Samba AD cannot test filters, credential providers or Security events; every acceptance needs a Windows VM.
- Pre-existing red on main: `fitness-modules` (18 violations) and gofmt on oidc/harness_test.go; not ours.
