# Runbook: CI, build and the repository scaffold

Standard: `knowledge/development/standards/ci-gates.md`. Layout: blueprint §1.

## Prerequisites

`go` (any 1.21+; it downloads the pinned 1.27.0 toolchain on first use, so the machine needs
network access once), `node` ≥ 22 with `npm`, `python3`, `make`, `bash`. Everything else is installed
by the targets: web packages by `npm ci`, gitleaks by `make secrets-install`.

## Everyday commands

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| The full gate (what the merge needs) | `make ci` (about 25 s warm) |
| Just lint / tests / fitness / build | `make lint`, `make test`, `make fitness`, `make build` |
| Format everything in place | `make fmt` |
| Prove the gates still fail on violations | `make ci-proof` |
| List all targets | `make help` |

## Fresh clone

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd activediq
make ci        # installs web dependencies from the lockfile, then runs every gate
```

If `make ci` fails on a fresh clone, that is a bug in the scaffold; file an `ops` ticket.

## When a gate fails

- **`gofmt`**: run `make fmt`.
- **`go mod tidy -diff`**: run `go mod tidy` and commit `go.mod`/`go.sum`.
- **`fitness-modules`**: the message names the file, line and blueprint rule. Fix the import. Do not
  edit the rule to pass; a rule changes only by amending the blueprint/ADR.
- **`npm ci` fails with a lockfile error**: `web/package.json` and the lockfile disagree; run
  `npm --prefix web install` once and commit both.
- **Go toolchain download fails**: check network/proxy (`go env GOPROXY`).
- **`secrets-scan`**: see `secret-scanning.md`.

## Adding code

- A new Go package goes where blueprint §1 says. Run `make fitness` early; it checks the import
  rules before a reviewer has to.
- A new dependency needs a row in `knowledge/business/licensing/open-source-license-register.md`
  first, with its exact package path in backticks.
- Go dependencies: `go get <path>@<exact version>` then `go mod tidy`. Web: `npm --prefix web i -E`.
